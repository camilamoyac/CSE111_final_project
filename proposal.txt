CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    Text Analytics

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    This program will help solve many problems such as: understanding a large
    amount of feedback for a company by identifying frequent positive or negative
    descriptions, getting the appropriate content in a search engine, or even
    literary analysis like finding motifs in novels, poems, or songs.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    I will learn more about data structures such as dictionaries and lists and
    the best way to make this program efficiently, and I will also learn about
    data analysis, and what things I can do with the words once I have the results.
    I also will probably learn more about language in general.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
    I will probbaly use the string module because I will be working with a lot
    of strings, maybe I will use csv for storing or reading data, and the pytest
    module to test my functions.

5. List the names of functions you will need?
    read_file()
    clean_text()
    count_words()
    main()

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
    test_read_file()
    test_clean_text()
    test_count_words()
