"Hello, world! Isn't it a beautiful day? 😊 Today, we’re exploring: punctuation—yes, all of it! Let's see... what's here? (parentheses), [brackets], {braces}; colon: semicolon; and of course... the ellipsis. Also, let's not forget... dashes—hyphens—and more!

For math-lovers: 2+2=4, π ≈ 3.14159. In programming, we use symbols like $, #, @, &, *, %, ~, ^, and |. Want more? Consider Markdown and its bold, italic, and strikethrough syntax.

Even more: @mentions, #hashtags, URLs (http://example.com), email@example.com, and file paths (/home/user/docs). Don't overlook "quotes" (single ‘quotes’ and “double quotes”), or even the backslash (\).

Let's end with some emoticons: :) :( ;)
